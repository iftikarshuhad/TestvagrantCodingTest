To run the Code  
Requirements : Java JDK or Eclipse.

Class Name : Testvagrant , there is only one class , the static classes are inside it , one 
can simply copy the code  and run in his/her system

In this project I have used Java Map Interface to link the Respective teams to the Points table and the respective match win/loss data.
Map gives us great benefit in storing and linking the data. 
This is a unique and easy approch in this problem sovling question.

I used Array List as the Dynamic Array for match win/loss data storage so the array can be increased or decreased when required.

The Map 1 is sorted according to the Values so we can dislay the Data in the perfect manner for viewers or users.

Regarding team Consecutive win/loss, it uses the ArrayList match data individually and calls the winLossCheck method and puts it in another list.

That new list containing the team name is used for Average Data calculation.
